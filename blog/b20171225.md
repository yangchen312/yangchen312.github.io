# Setting Up a Web Development Server on Mac OS  
WAMPs, MAMPs, and LAMPs is a package that binds the bundled programs for developing dynamic Internet web pages. They are abbreviations for "Windows/Mac/Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP". There are several available XAMP servers, here is a selection of some of the best:
  * XAMPP [http://apachefriends.org](http://apachefriends.org)
  * EasyPHP [http://www.easyphp.org](http://www.easyphp.org)
  * WAMPServer [http://www.wampserver.com/en/](http://www.wampserver.com/en/)
  * Glossword WAMP [http://glossword.biz/glosswordwamp/](http://glossword.biz/glosswordwamp/)

## Installing XAMPP on Mac OS
Download the *.dmg* file from http://apachefriends.org. Please note that the *installer* is downloaded instead of the *virtual machine*. Double-click the *.dmg* file, and then double-click the installer. The latest stable version is *7.2.0* at the time. Follow the instruction, you will complete the installation.  
The XAMPP is installed in the `/Applications/XAMPP` directory by default. You can open it by running the *manager-osx* application. The document root is the directory that contains the main web documents for a domain. By default, XAMPP uses the `/Applications/XAMPP/htdocs` directory as the document root.  
On the XAMPP Manager window, you can click the *Manage Servers* tab, and then click *Start All* to get the XAMPP servers running. After this, click the *Welcome* tab to direct to the main Manager screen, and then click the *Go to Application* button, which will call up the web page.  

## Testing the Installation
Upon running the XAMPP servers, type some HTML into a text editor or a IDE like *Eclipse PDT*, and save it in the document root as *test.html*. Then type `localhost/test.html` into the address bar of your browser, and you will see the expected web page.
```html
<html>
	<head>
		<title>A test</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		Hello World!
	</body>
</html>
```
